# Code Style Rules

- Follow Effective Dart guidelines
- Use strong typing; avoid `dynamic`
- Prefer `const` constructors where possible
- Use `final` for variables that aren't reassigned
- Prefer expression bodies for simple one-liner functions
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` unless state is required
- Extract reusable widgets into separate files
